= Introduction =

There are many researches that require an appropriate Resource Description Framework (RDF) dataset for their experiments. However, we still lack such a good dataset because:
# Some existing datasets do not contain large numbers of triplets, resources, or predicates, and so the scalability of real world data (e.g. Wikipedia) cannot be reflected.
# Some datasets require specific domain knowledge

This extraction toolkit enables user to generate Wikipedia infobox data in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format from Wikipedia data dumps.

== Description ==
This toolkit extracts the infobox RDF data from the Wikipedia data dumps in XML format, and the extracted data are stored in a user-specified PostgreSQL database.

The toolkit consists of a preliminary extraction tool, a data cleansing tool, and the RDF data extraction tool.
